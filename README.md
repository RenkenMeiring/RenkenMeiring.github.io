Thought process while designing my website:
With limited knowledge regarding the hosting of a website and Javascript, I decided to implement my website using HTML which I learned in Grade 12, with a bit of markdown. However simpler it might look or be, it serves the necessary requirements, satisfactorily in my opinion. For simplicity I didn’t use CSS for styling and so forth, as it was simple enough to implement editing or styling with “hard coding” and alternating between the preview field and code field of Github. 
I decided to start off with an introductory photo of me, used throughout my CV and LinkdIn profile as well, with a quote I tend to generally live by. Then it was easy to identify the main headings and branch out of them using the same format I used in my CV. This causes a golden thread to be weaved throughout the entirety of deliverable 1 and saved me time, which already was limited to being full-time employed.
