<h1>1. About Me</h1>
<p>I have a passion for mathematics and programming which is why I am currently studying a BSc in IT
online at the NWU Potchefstroom Campus. I love to broaden my horizons by constantly searching
for ways to advance my skills in any ways I can. I like to be artistic from time to time and pride
myself in my collection of succulents. 

Prior to entering higher education and the workplace environment I graduated grade 12 at Hoër Volkskool Potchefstroom with 8 distinctions and a 5-year academic colors of honor. All my relevant work experience, broadly in admin and healthcare, is as stipulated in my past positions. Additionally, I did courses in ICD 10 and 11 medical coding and billing, as well as 2 case management courses through Udemy.</p>

<h3><em>Co-Typer and Editor @Morné Smith</em></h3>
<p>I was assisting Morné with his mathematics publication he was in the process of writing as the co-typer and editor according to his needs and specifications. The publication is a Grade 10 handbook named Wiskunde, by Morné Smith (published 2023).</p>



<h2><strong>2023(January) - 2023(July)</strong></h2>
<h3><em>Receptionist @Dr TB Khumalo, Mediclinic Potchefstroom </em></h3>
<p>I was the receptionist for Dr TB Khumalo at Mediclinic Potchefstroom. I assisted him with making appointments, filling, medical aid claims, handling patients and attending to queries.</p>

<h3><em>Receptionist @Dr I Abdoola, Mediclinic Potchefstroom</em></h3>
<p>I was also the part-time receptionist for Dr I Abdoola at Mediclinic Potchefstroom. I assist him with handling patients, assisting him in the consultation room if needed during an in chair procedure, general paperwork and attending to queries. </p>

<h2><strong>2023(August) - 2023(November)</strong></h2>
<h3><em>Full-Time MHR Employee @Mediclinic Potchefstroom</em></h3>
<p>An MHR employee is a flexible employee that gets paid by the hour for the position you are standing in for. This is usually the case unless you are permanently booked for a certain position as I was for Confirmation Clerk and thus was mainly working in this area.</p>

<h3><em>1. Telephonist (Switchboard Operator)</em></h3>
<p>During this training and days I stood in for this position I had to have good telephone etiquette and diverted the calls as they came in to the relevant parties whilst having attention to listening carefully what the person requests and to whom to put them through to. There were also cases where I had to deal with complaints that needs to be diverted to the Patient Experience Manager or a relevant message should be taken or on the spot thinking for effectively diverting a query. </p>

<h3><em>2. Reception Administrator (Admissions Clerk)</em></h3>
<p>During this training and days I stood in for this position I worked directly with admitting patients, making bookings for patient’s scheduled procedures and effectively and efficiently handling day to day administrative tasks such as general patient queries, data capturing, auditing of colleagues’ work and maintaining this efficiency in peak times throughout the day. From time to time you’d also have to phone the medical aid’s for authorization or the phone would ring internally from a ward or external person wishing to speak to you, thus telephone etiquette was also essential.</p>

<h3><em>3. Confirmation Clerk (Case Manager)</em></h3>
<p>During this training and months I stood in for this position I was specifically trained for since I was standing in for a lady on maternity leave. I worked directly with medical aids and authorizations which are the key driver for an account to be correctly paid, thus attention to detail and learning pro-active ways of handling a case was key. I acquired a lot of my medical aid knowledge and medical coding knowledge with working with this hands on. I learned of different scheme rules and coding principles applying to certain cases or clinical documentation. I handled data capturing in relation to clinical information of a patient motivating their length of stay and I final coded casualty files. From time to time I had to contact patient’s regarding scheme rules, exclusions or struggles in a case in order for them to be aware of the financial risk they are currently in. The key driver for case management was to keep the hospital’s financial risk as low as possible whilst also assisting the patient’s as far possible that their admission(s) can be paid by the fund.</p>



<h2><strong>2024(January) - 2024(Current)</h2>
<h3><em>Practice Case Manager @Dr AJ Oberholzer’s General Practice </em></h3>
<p>As the case manager of the practice my purpose here would be to plan, seek, advocate for and monitor patients’ treatment plans. I act as the bridge between doctor, patient, medical aid and all other external parties in order to get optimal treatment from doctor with more than most times limited funding from the medical aids. My duties thus include communicating with patients throughout the process, whilst requesting authorization for procedures in-rooms or in hospital. I must also aid in motivating patients’ cases to the funds with not only the correct coding and administrative knowledge, but also the practical and technical know-how of the procedures. I also do follow-ups with the patients to see whether they are satisfied with the care from the various parties and whether they are satisfied with my services. I also then aid in looking into rejected cases in order to minimize patients’ debt at the practice and set them at ease having a person looking out for their financial needs, whilst also caring for their physical health.

Additional duties outside the scope of my position:
 <ul>
   <li>Calculating quotations for patient’s procedures.</li>
   <li>Assisting on the floor whether with filing, patient queries or taking vitals of patients.</li>
   <li>Assisting with in-room procedures by monitoring patient vitals and helping with the sonar machine by taking pictures or adjusting settings.</li>
   <li>Managing of all archived patient files, pharmacy slips and scripts, financial report and statements and excess consumables.</li>
   <li>Following-up on credit control queries for overdue claims struggling to pay out.</li> 
   <li>Assisting patients with payment transactions.</li>
   <li>Following-up outstanding blood results, radiology reports and reports from other doctors.</li>
 </ul>
